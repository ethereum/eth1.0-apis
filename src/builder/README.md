# Builder JSON-RPC API

The Builder JSON-RPC API is a collection of methods that external block building software must 
implement. This interface allows the communication between the consensus layer and external builders.

This API is in *active development* and currently [specified as a markdown document](./specification.md).
A schema will follow once the specification stabilizes.
